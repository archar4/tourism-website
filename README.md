A simple static tourism website with pages for home, tours, destinations, gallery, and contact.

## Features

- Clean, responsive HTML/CSS layout
- Pages: Home, Tours, Destinations, Gallery, Contact
- Assets folder contains images; `css/` and `js/` contain styles and scripts

## Project Structure

- index.html — Home page

## Preview / Run

Easy ways to preview the site locally:

- Open `index.html` directly in your browser.
- Or run a simple HTTP server (recommended for relative paths):

```bash
# Python 3
python -m http.server 8000

# Then open http://localhost:8000 in your browser
```

If you use VS Code, the Live Server extension also works well.
